This project is an Express API built with Express.

## Getting Started

To start the service, use the following command:
<<<<<<< HEAD

```bash

~~~
>>>>>>> 15c4f41 (Update README.md)
npm start

Before running the above command, ensure you have MongoDB running. You can use the script start-project.bat to automate this process:
./start-project.bat

This script will handle starting both MongoDB and the Node server.
